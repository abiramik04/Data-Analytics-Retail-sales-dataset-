2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Gender and age distribution.  
   - Revenue contribution by product category.  

3. **Visualizations:**  
   - Bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, and pie charts.  
   - Correlation heatmaps and violin plots.  
   - Line plots for monthly revenue trends.  

4. **Recommendations:**  
   - Insights on product focus and customer targeting.
